# Scraping web data using PhantomJS and Selenium in AWS Server(Linux Server)

 Here I am using Phantomjs in selenium to scrape data from the link given in the snippet. While extracting the data with element.text in phantomjs(web_element), I am getting some blank values in between where as if I use chromedriver I was able to scrape all data.

I can only run using headless browser since I am running it in AWS Linux server
